#### Likes
* Level designing the maze to make it interesting and make it look like cardboard logo. 
* Making my models come to life.


#### Chanllenges 
* The worst challenge was to get the light right! Everytime i build to android the whole screen turn dark and I need to switch platform to PC and build for android again.
* To optimize the scene which has a lot of models by occluding the objects that are not visible to the camera.
