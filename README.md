Name: Mohammed Alsayed Ahmed Omar
Time taken: 3 weeks
Likes: Level designing the maze to make it interesting and make it look like cardboard logo. Also, modelling my own assets.
Chanllenges: The worst challenge was to get the light right! Everytime i build to android the whole screen turn dark and I need to switch platform to PC and build for android again.
The second challenge was the "SETPASS CALLS". As the environment is really big, The setpass calls were a lot and caused performance issues. So I baked Occlusion map to occlude the objects that are not seen by the camera to save performance
Thank you.
